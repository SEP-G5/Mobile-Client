# Mobile-Client

We are building an application for trading bicycles, by utilizing the blockchain technology. We also plan to build a client application where the users can do transactions such as buying or selling a bicycle. We want to use a combination of technologies that all teammates have experience working on while keeping an interesting project that is technologically challenging.

In this system, there are two components, frontend and [backend](https://github.com/SEP-G5/Backend).
